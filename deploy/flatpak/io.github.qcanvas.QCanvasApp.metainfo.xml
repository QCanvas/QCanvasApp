                <ul>
                    <li>Database changes: If you used QCanvas previously, you will need to re-synchronise. The old database is not deleted, and will still work with older versions. The new database will use a new file.</li>

                    <li>Assignment comments and comment attachments are now shown</li>
                    <li>Announcement attachments are now shown (which were previously not stored)</li>
                    <li>Synchronisation now uses HTTP2, which may improve speed</li>
                    <li>Minor UI tweaks</li>
                    <li>Update to Qt 6.8</li>
